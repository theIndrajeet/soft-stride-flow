# Git Push Issue - Disk Space Problem

## Issue Identified
Your disk is 95% full with only 11GB of free space. This is causing:
- Git database write failures
- File corruption issues
- "Bus error" and "short read" errors

## Current Disk Status
- Total: 228GB
- Used: 186GB
- Available: 11GB (5% free)

## Solution Required
You need to free up disk space before we can push to GitHub. Recommended:
1. **Free up at least 20-30GB** of disk space
2. Empty your Trash
3. Delete old downloads or large files you don't need
4. Use Disk Utility to check for purgeable space

## What I've Done
1. ✅ Built the complete Soft Stride Flow app
2. ✅ Created all UI components and pages
3. ✅ Set up database schema
4. ✅ Initialized a fresh git repository
5. ❌ Cannot commit/push due to disk space

## Next Steps After Freeing Space
Once you've freed up disk space, run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/issac/Desktop/soft-stride-flow

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Complete rebuild: Mental health-friendly todo app with neurodivergent-focused features"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main --force
```

## Alternative: Manual Backup
If you can't free space immediately, you can:
1. Copy the entire `soft-stride-flow` folder to an external drive
2. Upload files manually to GitHub through the web interface
3. Use a cloud service to backup the project

The app is fully built and ready - we just need disk space to push it to GitHub!
